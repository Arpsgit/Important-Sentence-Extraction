# Important-Sentence-Extraction

### This web app can extract the names and different methods used in a research paper.

## Click here to use this app: [Important-Sentence-Extraction](https://arpsgit-important-sentence-extraction-main-u6gwyf.streamlit.app/) :innocent:
We just have to provide the passages from the research paper's method section in the text area of the app and click the "Find" button, it'll fetch the important sentences from the passage.
